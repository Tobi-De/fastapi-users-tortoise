# Fastapi-users-tortoise

Fastapi-users database adapter for tortoise orm.

## Development

### Setup environment

You should create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv/
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

And then install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

### Run unit tests

You can run all the tests with:

```bash
make test
```

Alternatively, you can run `pytest` yourself:

```bash
pytest
```

There are quite a few unit tests, so you might run into ulimit issues where there are too many open file descriptors. You may be able to set a new, higher limit temporarily with:

```bash
ulimit -n 2048
```

### Format the code

Execute the following command to apply `isort` and `black` formatting:

```bash
make format
```
